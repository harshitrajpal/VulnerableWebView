# Vulnerable WebView

This is an example application of a webview that fires an intent with URL parameter as an extra to redirect to a site within a webview client.
Please feel free to use this application to perform demo of vulnerable webview attacks.

If you want the source code, please message me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshit-rajpal-79bb43103/

Will be uploading a sample exploit of this soon.
